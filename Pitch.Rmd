## About Course Project
For the final week of the Developing Data Products course on Coursera, I was asked to create a Shiny app using functionality we learned about in the course. I chose to submit a Mandelbrot set viewer I created earlier in the course to learn about the different functionality of Shiny apps including reactivity, interactive plots, and updating based on user input.

## The Mandelbrot Set
